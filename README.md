This is my first steps at learning Rust, please be kind.

I'm building a guessing game that picks a random number between 1 and 100, and then the user has to guess it.
In fact I'm following the official [Rust tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
